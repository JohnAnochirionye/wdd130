    <p>Hello everyone. I am John nochirionye from Nigeria. 
        I love to play chess, scrabble games, watching football and 
        researching. 
        I love innovative ideas and wish to contribute to society with the skills I shall acquire 
        from completing this course as well as other interesting courses in my degree program. 
        I had my first degree in Physics from Federal University of Technology Owerri.
        It is my desire to establish an IT company/institution with the skills I shall acquire from this 
        program. I am a returned missionary and currently serve as a ward clerk in my local unit as well as a
        Technology Specialist in my Stake.
        I love learning and improving. I am currently a BYU-pathway missionary in my locality 
        and desire to have more people enroll and gain the needed skills to better their lives.
        I am currently pursuing my second degree via BYU-Pathway Worldwide.
        I am passionate to be a more disciple leader in my home, church and in my community.
        I love to collaborate with people of great minds even in this program.
    </p>
