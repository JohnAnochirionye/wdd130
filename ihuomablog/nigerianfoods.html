                Nigeria with her numerous cultural heritage haven over 200
                ethnic groups with each tribe haven a uniquic type of foood that
                is associated with them. <br />
                we bring to you a feel of some these special means found in
                Nigeria. <br />Tuwo Shinkafa was invented by the Hausa tribe who
                used to live in the northern area of the country. It comes in
                the form of ball-shaped mashed rice or corn. <br />Nigerian
                people love to make food from the cassava root, also called
                “Garri.” They use dried grated cassava flour to make Ẹ̀bà, a
                comfort food that is very popular among Yoruba people. It is
                also made in other West African sub-regions. <br />Ẹ̀bà is made
                by cooking dried grated cassava flour in hot water and shaping
                it into a large ball. Its color can be white or yellow,
                depending on how it is cooked. If people add palm oil when
                drying the grated cassava, then the dish will have a yellow hue.
                <br />People eat Ẹ̀bà using their fingers. They take out a small
                piece, turn it into a small ball, and then dip it in soup or
                stew. <br />Egusi is the Nigerian word for “Melon.” The Yoruba
                people created a soup from melon seed years ago and named it
                “Egusi.” However, some theories posit that it actually belongs
                to the Igbo people.You will also see “Egusi” in the food culture
                of Cameroon, Mali, Ghana, and many more African countries.
                Ground melon seeds are used to create a thick consistency of the
                soup. Other ingredients include meat, fish, vegetables, and
                seasonings. It has a distinctive nutty and spicy taste, thanks
                to melon seeds. Nigerian people often eat Egusi soup at
                celebrations and festivals. It is one of the most popular
                delicacies in this country. Egusi and Fufu is a perfect Nigerian
                lunch combo. <br />Abacha is native to the Igbo tribe, who
                resided in Eastern Nigeria. It is made from the Nigerians'
                favorite root vegetable, cassava. Most vegetable dishes in this
                country are created from cassava. Although local people often
                consider this salad a street food. It is also a Nigerian dessert
                recipe. Feel free to enjoy it as a refreshing African dessert if
                you want to. To make Abacha, people dry and shred cassava. It is
                also seasoned with calabash nutmeg and other species. Then they
                top it with fried meat or fish. Abacha is traditionally served
                alongside Ugba, made from oil bean seeds. Abacha may be the best
                salad that you've ever tasted.
